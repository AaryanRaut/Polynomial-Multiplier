# Polynomial-Multiplier

This project is a Polynomial Multiplier implemented in C that allows you to create, display, and multiply two polynomials. It utilizes a linked list structure to represent and manipulate polynomials.

Features:
Create polynomials with user-defined coefficients and powers.
Display the created polynomials.
Multiply two polynomials and display the result.

Project Structure:
The main functionalities are handled through a linked list of nodes, where each node represents a term in the polynomial (coefficient and power).
